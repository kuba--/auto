# Auto

Auto is a simple game made in [Godot](https://godotengine.org).
It's a combination of _maze_, _city explorer_ and _snake_ like games, where you have few seconds to explore the city as much as possible.
The tricky part can be steering, because you steer the car as a driver (like in RC cars). Also every second the car drives a little bit faster.

I could not create this game without great free assets.
